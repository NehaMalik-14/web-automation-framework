# Web Automation Framework using Python & Selenium

A robust, modular, and data-driven test automation framework built with **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **PyTest**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

This project demonstrates best practices in test automation design, including:
- Structured folder architecture
- Reusable page object classes
- External test data support (Excel, CSV)
- Synchronization (Explicit/Implicit waits)
- Logging and error handling
- CI/CD ready design
